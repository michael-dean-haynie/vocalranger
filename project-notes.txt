Range
  - lowFreq/lowKeyNo
  - highFreq/highKeyNo
  - register****
  - recording

* The following 3 asterisks are actually being replaced by id's for Register and RegisterSystem tables
* register will be a special ID created by the ORM or something that identifies which system is being used (4reg or 3reg) which physiology (m or f) and which actual register within those. ex: 4RS-M-0 or 3RS-F-3
* 4RS: Vocal Fry, Modal, Falsetto, whistle. 3RS: (men) chest, head, falsetto (women) chest, mid, head
* there will also be a simple register that spans the whole vocal range. Just one low and one high. ex: 1RS
